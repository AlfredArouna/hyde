<p>I&#8217;m leaving tomorrow for my first trip to Boston.  I&#8217;m pretty psyched about it.</p>
<p>Worked a bit on epiphany/dashboard today.  Updated the frontend patch to work with the new <span class="caps">API</span>, and also built an <span class="caps">RPM</span> (<a href="http://www.snorp.net/files/packages/epiphany-0.7.3-2.i386.rpm">http://www.snorp.net/files/packages/epiphany-0.7.3-2.i386.rpm</a>).  It requires mozilla from xd2 (sorry, it&#8217;s what I have).</p>
<p>It sounds like the dashboard demo at the o&#8217;reilly conference went pretty well.  I suppose it will be getting even <b>more</b> attention now.  Good stuff.</p>
