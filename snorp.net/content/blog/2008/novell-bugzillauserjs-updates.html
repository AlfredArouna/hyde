<p>I&#8217;ve updated the Novell Bugzilla Autologin greasemonkey script again.  Just click <a href="http://www.snorp.net/files/novell-bugzilla.user.js">here</a> to upgrade your current version or install it for the first time.  You of course need greasemonkey installed.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve removed the &#8220;go to login page&#8221; step.  It now just logs in directly via <span class="caps">AJAX</span> and refreshes your current page.  It has also been rewritten to use jQuery (and jQuery.blockUI) which cleaned things up a bit and gives a nicer &#8220;please wait&#8221; message :)</p>
