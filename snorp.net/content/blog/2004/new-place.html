<p>I moved today.  It went pretty well.  Amy and her parents helped out a lot so that was good.  Rupert is back online so that made people happy.</p>
<p>A guy (Darren Brierton) has been mailing me lately about rcd on fc2, and eventually he told me he wanted to get <a href="http://www.redhat.com/archives/fedora-list/2004-July/msg03182.html">rcd into fedora</a>.  He totally rules.</p>
<p>9 days till wedding :)</p>
<p><b>Update:</b>  I committed mono bindings for libredcarpet to <span class="caps">CVS</span> this week.  Ph33r.</p>
