<p>I totally wanted to go to <span class="caps">GUADEC</span>, but couldn&#8217;t for various reasons (time and money, mostly).  It was almost like being there, though, when I was able to make fun of <a href="http://primates.ximian.com/~dave/log">Dave</a> during his talk by proxy.  Seriously.  I think next year each room should have a projector showing a moderated <span class="caps">IRC</span> channel where people can ask questions.</p>
<p>Work has been going well lately, finally getting back into the groove after being pulled in different directions for a while.</p>
<p>Wedding plans are progressing, invitations went out last week.  Really starting to hit home now :)</p>
